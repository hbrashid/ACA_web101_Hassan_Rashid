                Coding is woven into everything we touch. It’s present at home and work. Many children's first interaction with technology is in their hospital room. With camera phones taking photos left and right, or maybe a selfie thrown in for good measure. Then of course, they’ll have their hands on their parent’s phone within 6 months.
                For adults the experience isn’t much different. While we may not have grown up with computers in our pockets, we have them now, and they’re more so attached to our hands at this point. All of these technological interactions are driven by code. All of these taps and clicks are written by programmers to deliver certain results. It’s hard to find someone not looking at their phone nowadays. Whether you’re at home or out at a park, we all have a device for time-killing or scenic picture taking.
                The ability to create for all of these screens, to enable powerful experiences on all of the devices we use for home and work, that’s exciting to me. Software is a part of our lives, dare I say every second of our lives, and being able to contribute to that and manipulate that and create that experience is truly powerful.
                One of the first things you learn in html is doctype. It’s the first thing written on your html document. Its purpose is to identify to the web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) what html version the document is written in.
                HTML is somewhat of a basic language in terms of design capabilities. To add style to web pages and to really make them an experience, you use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In CSS, a selector is used to specify which area of code certain style effects will be executed on. Browsers read these selectors from right-to-left and match it against the CSS element. They employ this method because it results in quicker analysis of the code.
                Vocabulary is one of the trickiest and most important aspects when it comes learning something new. Proper understanding of terminology will help give you a quicker and greater grasp of the subject at hand. For example, an HTML tag is basically the structure tags, such as <html></html> and <body></body> and so on. An HTML element is the whole enchilada so to speak. It includes the tags and the content within those tags. Such as <title>Coding information</title>.
                CSS is the flair to the staleness of HTML. One of the main features is the “Cascade”. It basically boils down to an algorithm, or an order of operations, that sorts through values and outputs a single value. Another way to think about it is as a points based grading rubric. Giving certain attributes more weight than others.
                CSS can be done in three different ways when styling an html file. Inline, internal, and external. Let’s start with inline CSS, which is mainly used when adding style for a single element. It’s added right inline with the html element and can be used for any CSS property. Such as, &lt;h1> style=“Color:blue;”>Check out this heading</h1>.
                Next up is internal CSS, which is mainly used when styling for a single page. This is done with a &lt;style> tag and falls under the &lt;head> section.
                And lastly we have external CSS, which is determined to be best practice when it comes to implementing CSS. The whole web experience can be changed within one separate file. This external style sheet is linked with a <link> tag under the <head> section.
                CSS takes the HTML content and adds the applicable style information. This is done via the browser, as it parses and sorts the different CSS selectors. Most of the time CSS is done via an external style sheet, thus saving time and making for a cleaner operation. CSS can change colors, heights and widths, fonts, align text, and much more. It gives the web life.
                There are multiple ways to select an HTML element in CSS. CSS selectors consists of type, class, ID, and many more. Choosing the right CSS selector can depend on many factors. Class and ID selectors tend to be great for specifying certain HTML content and being clear and concise. Type is used for more general areas, such as &lt;body> and &lt;h1>. The other selectors, such as attribute and pseudo-classes, all end up being used for varying degrees of specificity. It’s important to use selectors that you can edit later if needed, while keeping a clean style sheet.
